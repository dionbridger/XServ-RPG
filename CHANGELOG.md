# Working
- Came up with basic component classes for `simulation` package, which will form the foundation of all simulations.
- Created complete worked-out example of gear-train implemented using `simulation` package, showing how a SimGraph can be used to compute the rotation of a gear mesh. 
- Added support for allowing gear meshes that "lock up" - i.e. are arranged in a way that makes turning impossible.
