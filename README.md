## What is XServ-RPG?
XServ-RPG is an ambitious project aiming to facilitate writing detailed simulation games in a declarative way. 

## Setting expectations
Until further notice, set them low! This is a hobby project consisting of contributions from interested volunteers. 
The current main goal is to write enough of the framework to enable a complete demo game (unnamed interstellar alien bounty-hunting game). 

## Running Tests
Tests are run using pytest. To run tests, run `pip install pytest` in your venv and run `pytest .`

## Generating documentation
Documentation is generated with the pdoc package. Currently requires running `pdoc --html <package name>` for each package so this can be improved.
